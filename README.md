### Overview
Connects to the Discord Gateway, listens for commands in a configured guild/channel, and executes post-exploitation actions (file operations, shell, screenshots, webcam capture, persistence, etc.).

### Disclaimer
For educational and research purposes only. Use exclusively on systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test. The author is not responsible for misuse or damage.

### Modules Used
- Password stealing, token grabbing, webcam capture, and rootkit features are provided by prebuilt DLLs sourced from the "moom825" Discord-RAT-2.0 repository.

### Credits
- Rootkit by "bytecode77" â†’ https://github.com/bytecode77/r77-rootkit

### Setup Guide
Download the precompiled binaries from the releases page.

1. Create a Discord bot in the Discord Developer Portal and add it to your server with sufficient permissions (admin recommended).
2. Open `builder.exe`, paste your bot token and the guild ID.
3. Run the generated `Client-built.exe`. It creates a control channel (e.g., `session-#`) and posts a session banner.

### Requirements
- Windows (x64)

### Defensive Analysis (for researchers)
- Architecture
  - Discord Gateway client over WebSocket; logs in with a bot token; listens for events; dispatches `!`-prefixed commands.
  - Dynamically downloads and loads DLL modules in-memory for passwords, tokens, webcam, and rootkit features.
  - Creates and uses a control channel named like `session-#` in the configured guild.
- Network Endpoints
  - `wss://gateway.discord.gg` (Discord Gateway)
  - `https://discord.com/api/v9/...` (messages, channels CRUD)
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moom825/Discord-RAT-2.0/.../*.dll` (module DLLs)
  - `https://geolocation-db.com/json` (IP + geo)
  - `https://file.io/` (large file uploads)
- Persistence & Tampering
  - HKCU Run key: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` value like `$77{exeName}`
  - Scheduled task (admin): `schtasks /create ... /rl HIGHEST` with name `$77{exeName}`
  - Task Manager disable: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableTaskMgr=1`
  - Process critical flag via `NtSetInformationProcess`
- Command Categories
  - Execution/Control: `!shell`, `!website`, `!voice`, shutdown/restart/logoff
  - Filesystem: upload, download, delete, current/dir listing, wallpaper set
  - Collection: screenshot, clipboard, process list, geolocate, password/token grab
  - Webcam: list/select cams, capture picture
  - Privilege/Admin: UAC bypass attempt, defender/firewall disable, taskmgr disable/enable, startup, critical process
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
  - Registry artifacts listed above; `$77`-prefixed values and scheduled task names
  - Discord artifacts: channels named `session-#`; bot posting session banners
  - Network to the endpoints above; raw GitHub DLL fetches
  - File artifacts: downloaded DLLs if saved temporarily (depends on run path)
- Safe VM Analysis Checklist
  - Isolate VM (no shared folders/clipboard); take a snapshot first
  - Block `gateway.discord.gg` and `discord.com` (hosts or firewall) to prevent real C2
  - Monitor with ProcMon (registry/files), ETW/process tracing, and packet capture
  - Perform static review of `Discord rat/Program.cs` for command handlers and URLs; inspect bundled DLLs with a .NET decompiler (do not execute)
